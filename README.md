# sign-up-form
- Focusing on clean, modular CSS with limited extra rules.
- Implementing both function declarations and expressions based on requirement in code.

To Do:
- Add event listener for read and delete buttons
	- Need to somehow associate the event listener with the book / id, to delete the right one.
- make read button toggle readStatus
- make delete button delete card
- make checkLibrary() to check if book has already been added.
